		<h1>Suzdal: An open-air museum</h1>
		<p>Suzdal is one of the most popular destinations on the Golden Ring and the whole city is often described as an open-air museum. Suzdal is a relatively small city and it is not difficult to walk around the city to see most of the sights. The main sights of Suzdal are located on the road Ulitsa Lenina, including the two main sights: the Suzdal Kremlin in the south and the Spaso-Yevfimiev Monastery in the north. The city has no railway station and practically no heavy industry, meaning that is has preserved its provincial charm and a great deal of architectural monuments.</p>

		<h1>Trip</h1>
		<p>From Moscow, Suzdal is not as easy to get to as Sergiev Posad (the closest Golden Ring city to the capital) but it is worth going the extra distance as Suzdal provides more of a contrast from Moscow.  If you make use of high-speed trains it is possible and not too demanding to visit for even just a day, but of course spending the night there is recommended to soak in the atmosphere or to combine it with a visit to neighbouring Vladimir.  As the city is a very popular tourist destination you will have no problem finding a cafe or guesthouse there.  There is practically no public transport in the city, but the city is small and most sights are located relatively close to each other.</p>
