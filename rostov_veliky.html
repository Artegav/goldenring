		<h1>Rostov-Veliky: ancient city</h1>
		<p> Rostov-Veliky is one of the most interesting and ancient cities on the Golden Ring, which has the most beautiful kremlin of the whole tourist route.  It makes a great day trip from Moscow as even though it is quite far it has good transport links.  It is not as established a tourist destination as Sergiev Posad and Suzdal, meaning that, although it has a less developed infrastructure, it has more provincial charm.</p>

		<h1>Trip</h1>
		<p>Rostov-Veliky has good transport links with Moscow and Yaroslavl, being situated on part of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The train leaves from Moscow's Yaroslavsky Railway Station and takes just under 2¾ hours.  You should buy tickets in advance as if for a long-distance train. The train only stops in Rostov for a minute, so make sure you are ready to get off or get on before it stops. From Rostov-Veliky Bus Station you can get a bus to Borisoglebsky, which is worth visiting to see its famous fortified monastery.</p>
