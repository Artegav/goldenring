		<h1>The mediaeval capital of Russia</h1>
		<p>As the mediaeval capital of Russia, Vladimir is unsurprisingly rich in history, however whereas neighbouring Suzdal has retained it unspoiled landscapes and become a major tourist destination, Vladimir is now a rather industrialised city. Most visitors only make a small detour to Vladimir’s central square to visit its famous cathedrals. However the city is an official Golden Ring city and certainly has enough to offer to fill a whole day. Vladimir enjoys good transport links with Moscow, meaning a day trip is a perfect option to see the city. If you have more time though you can easily combine a trip to Vladimir with a trip to Suzdal.</p>

		<h1>Trip</h1>
		<p>The easiest way to get to Vladimir from Moscow is to go on a high-speed train. There are three high-speed trains: the Sapsan, the Lastochka and the Burevestnik. All three run between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod. The trains leave from Moscow’s Kursky Railway Station and take around 1¾ to 2 hours. The cheapest of the three trains is the Lastochka and the most expensive is the Sapsan. Tickets should be booked in advance of your trip. A cheaper alternative is to get a standard suburban train from Kursky Railway Station to Vladimir, but these take around 3 hours. Buses to Vladimir also leave frequently from close to Kursky Railway Station, but these can take up to 4 hours if the traffic is bad.</p>
