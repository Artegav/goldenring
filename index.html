            The Golden Ring of Russia is a tourist route that was specifically
            developed in the late 1960s uniting several mediaeval Russian cities
            located to the north-east of Moscow. Today it is the main and most
            popular tourist route around provincial cities of central European
            Russia. The route consists of eight principal cities and several
            additional, unofficial secondary cities located in the Ivanovo,
            Kostroma, Moscow, Vladimir and Yaroslavl regions. 
          <br /><br />
            Golden Ring Route incorporates cities in the region historically
            known as Zalesye, which literally means ‘beyond the forest’ in
            reference to its location from Kiev - then the capital of the Rus
            state (Kievan Rus). Once considered a backwater of Rus it later
            developed into the powerful Suzdal Principality and then the
            Vladimir Grand Principality, which eventually eclipsed Kiev as the
            seat of the most senior Rus prince. Vladimir would remain the
            capital of Rus until it was in turn eclipsed by Moscow. <br /><br />

            The main attractions of the cities on the route are the old
            buildings that have been preserved here, especially the monasteries
            and churches, and there are even several UNESCO World Heritage
            Sites. In addition to this, the cities are very provincial and
            located among the beautiful Russian countryside. Therefore the
            Golden Ring preserves a perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of
            Moscow, so it is definitely worth visiting at least one Golden Ring
            city if you are in Moscow for more than a couple of days.
            <br /><br />

            The Golden Ring of Russia is the main and most popular tourist route
            around provincial cities of central European Russia. There is no
            officially defined list of all the cities included on the route, but
            you can find a list of the cities frequently included on our Golden
            Ring Cities page. In any case, there are certainly a few cities
            which you should see and some you can skip.
